Replies to any twitter mentions with a quotation.
This project is already set up to be deployed to heroku. You will need a redis addon, and probably
a scheduler to run the scripts in bin.

Note: Must set up 5 environment variables:
- TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
- TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
- TWITTER_OAUTH_SECRET
- TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN
- QUOTATION_URL

for the underquoted, use the following QUOTATION_URL:
'https://underquoted.herokuapp.com/api/v2/quotations/?random=true&limit=1'
